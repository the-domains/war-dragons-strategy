**Luminark**

* **Rank**: Orange
* **Type:** Sorcerer
* **Class:** Epic

As a sorcerer, Luminark suffers from being unable to apply concentrated fire to a tower. Thankfully, having the Summon Warrior spell at an early age means that he is more than capable of holding his own.

One of the few dragons who have access to red and blue spells, this versatility helps when defenders have not designed their base to combat this. Luminark is a strong dragon up until around level 45 or so where he starts to lose effectiveness.
